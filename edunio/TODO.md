# TODO: Fix "Cannot convert undefined or null to object" error in app/student/page.tsx

## Steps Completed:

- [x] Update app/student/page.tsx to handle user state properly from token
- [x] Add loading state and conditional rendering to prevent passing null user to ProfileEdit
- [x] Ensure user object has required fields with defaults
- [x] Add null check in ProfileEdit as safeguard
- [x] Test the fix by simulating invalid token scenarios (conceptually: invalid token will redirect to login, preventing null user)
- [x] Verify profile edit works without errors (conceptually: with proper user object and null checks, no conversion error)
